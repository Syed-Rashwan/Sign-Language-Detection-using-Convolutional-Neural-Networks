# **Sign Language Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks**

## **Overview**
This project aims to detect and classify sign language gestures using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It leverages deep learning techniques to provide an accurate and efficient solution for recognizing sign language gestures, enabling seamless communication for individuals with hearing or speech impairments.

---

## **Features**
- **Deep Learning Model**: A CNN-based architecture to classify hand gestures.
- **Dataset Preprocessing**: Tools for preparing images for model training and evaluation.
- **Interactive Interface**: A frontend interface to interact with the model and test predictions.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Integration with live video streams (optional future enhancement).

## **Getting Started**

### **1. Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.8 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- Virtual environment tools (e.g., `venv` or `conda`)

### **2. Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Syed-Rashwan/Sign-Language-Detection-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks.git
   cd Sign-Language-Detection-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
   ```
2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate      # On Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate         # On Windows
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## **Usage**

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- Open the `Notebooks/Data_Preprocessing.ipynb` notebook.
- Ensure the dataset is organized in the `Dataset/` folder with subfolders for each gesture.
- Run the preprocessing steps to prepare the data for training.

### **2. Model Training**
- Open the `Notebooks/Model_Training.ipynb` notebook.
- Train the CNN model or load the pre-trained model from `Models/model.h5`.

### **3. Running the Application**
- Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
- Access the web interface at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
- Upload images of gestures to test predictions.

---

## **Testing**
To ensure the project works correctly:
1. Validate the dataset preprocessing pipeline.
2. Verify model training and accuracy on test data.
3. Test the Flask application with multiple gestures.

---

## **Enhancements**
### **Planned Features**
- Add real-time gesture recognition using a webcam.
- Improve model accuracy with a larger dataset or transfer learning.
- Include support for additional gestures.
- Add feedback for misclassified gestures.

### **UI Improvements**
- Create a more user-friendly and responsive interface using Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.
- Add progress bars or animations for file uploads and predictions.
